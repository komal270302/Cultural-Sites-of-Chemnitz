## Cultural Sites of Chemnitz

# Project Overview
This is a web application developed as a term paper project for the course "Datenbanken und Web-Techniken" in the Web Engineering study program at Technische Universit√§t Chemnitz. The application allows users to explore cultural sites in Chemnitz, including museums, restaurants, artworks, and more, displayed on an interactive map. It features user authentication, favorites, reviews, and an admin dashboard. The app fetches cultural site data from OpenStreetMap (via GeoJSON), stores it in a MySQL database, and provides a frontend interface for browsing, filtering, and interacting with the sites.

# Features
- User Authentication: Register and login with JWT-based security. The first registered user becomes an admin.
- Interactive Map: Displays cultural sites using Leaflet.js, with markers for locations, details on click (name, type, website), and geolocation centering.
- Search and Filters: Filter sites by tourism/amenity types or search by name.
- Favorites: Add/remove sites to favorites and view a filtered list/map.
- Reviews: Add, edit, delete, and view reviews with ratings (1-5 stars) for sites.
- Top Rated Sites: View sites sorted by average rating.
- User Profile: Update name, email, or password.
- Admin Dashboard: View statistics (active/deleted users, sites, reviews, favorites) in a pie chart, manage users (deactivate/restore), and view deleted users.
- Data Management: Sites data imported from GeoJSON and stored in the database.

# Technologies Used
- Backend: Python with FastAPI, MySQL (via mysql-connector-python), JWT for authentication (jose, passlib).
